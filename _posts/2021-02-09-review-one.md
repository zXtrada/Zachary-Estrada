### _Summary_
_Virtual St. Paul’s Cross Project_ is an auditory and visual digital recreation of a sermon delivered in 1622 by John Donne in Paul's Cross, outside of Old St. Paul's Cathedral. After multiple fires and decaying state of the Old St. Paul's Cathedral and its surrounding courtyards, it was demolished in 1668 in order to build a new cathedral. This project was made to digitally restore a place of preaching and worship and allow for modern day audiences to experience a space that existed hundreds of years ago.

### _Design_
The 3D virtual model was created using Google SketchUp (shown above) by Joshua Stephens, a graduate student in architecture at NC State University. Images were then rendered from the model and imported into Photoshop by Jordan Gray, another graduate student in architecture from NC State, and details and shading were added to make a more photorealistic image (shown below). The acoustic model was created by Ben Markham and Matt Azevedo using the CATT acoustic modeling program. They are working on a Virtual Reality version of the model using _Epic Games'_ Unreal Engine game environment.
