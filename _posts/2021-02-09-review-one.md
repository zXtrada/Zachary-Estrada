### _Summary_
_Virtual St. Paul’s Cross Project_ is an auditory and visual digital recreation of a sermon delivered in 1622 by John Donne in Paul's Cross, outside of Old St. Paul's Cathedral. After multiple fires and decaying state of the Old St. Paul's Cathedral and its surrounding courtyards, it was demolished in 1668 in order to build a new cathedral. This project was made to digitally restore a place of preaching and worship and allow for modern day audiences to experience a space that existed hundreds of years ago.
