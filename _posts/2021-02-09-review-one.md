### _Summary_
_Virtual St. Paul’s Cross Project_ is an auditory and visual digital recreation of a sermon delivered in 1622 by John Donne in Paul's Cross, outside of Old St. Paul's Cathedral. After multiple fires and decaying state of the Old St. Paul's Cathedral and its surrounding courtyards, it was demolished in 1668 in order to build a new cathedral. This project was made to digitally restore a place of preaching and worship and allow for modern day audiences to experience a space that existed hundreds of years ago.

### _Design_
The 3D virtual model was created using Google SketchUp (shown above) by Joshua Stephens, a graduate student in architecture at NC State University. Images were then rendered from the model and imported into Photoshop by Jordan Gray, another graduate student in architecture from NC State, and details and shading were added to make a more photorealistic image (shown below). The acoustic model was created by Ben Markham and Matt Azevedo using the CATT acoustic modeling program. The project team is also working on a Virtual Reality version of the model using _Epic Games'_ Unreal Engine game environment.

As for the website, it has a very simple and minimalistic design that is easy to navigate. It breaks down its many pages into headings with drop-down menus that are always accessible. Each page also uses different images, models, and video/audio clips along with headers to break up the text into smaller, more digestible paragraphs. The homepage also conveniently links the important parts of the project and provides instructions on how to navigate the website. However, this site is not optimized for mobile use. While it is still useable, more than half of the screen is taken up by blank space and requires the user to zoom in order to read the information. This could deter a mobile user from wanting to use this site to learn about the project.

### _Relevance_

The _Virtual St. Paul’s Cross Project_ integrates numerous disciplines in the field of humanities. It utilizes scholars of architecture, language, history, religion, and theater, along with acoustic engineers and programmers to produce every aspect of this project. It introduces the possibility to bring other historic events and places to life with technology for modern audiences to experience.
