### _Summary_

_The Atlas of Early Printing_ is an interactive map showing the development of printing in Europe from 1450-1500. While 50 years seems like a short period of time, the project shows just how much the art of printing was able to advance as quickly as it did. 

### _Design_

The site has a simple design with a pleasant color scheme and is incredibly easy to navigate. It has three headers at the top of the page to explore the entire site: one takes you to the interactive map, one has a drop down containing information about the project, and the last with a dropdown containing additional information about printing. While there is no mobile version of the site, it is still usable on mobile or tablet with minimal frustration. 

The map was made using ESRI's ArcGIS software using data incorporated in a GIS Server. It also features layers that can be selected and shown on the map in order to see where different factors lie on the map. This allows the user to view where different printers were situated, how much they output, and which typographies they used. The user can then use the map to make connections between different geographic factors like **Ecclesiastical Borders** and **Trade Routes** or the locations of **Paper Mills** and **Universities** that affected the advancement of printing. The adjustable timeline was created using jQuery UI Slider and allows the user to change which period of time they are viewing on the map.

The site includes a page labeled **Using the Atlas** with instructions on how to use the atlas. However, this page also has a lot of other information about the atlas that could be put in an _About_ tab instead. Another option would be to separate the text into section headers to break up the long paragraphs of text. 

### _Relevance_

The creators of the project intended to use this project as a tool to teach the early history of printing in fifteenth-century Europe. They wanted to note the importance of how rapidly trade expanded as a result the innovations made to the printing process. This project incorporates the fields of literature, history, and geography with ArcGIS mapping technology, making it a great example of Digital Humanities.

### _Findings_

Something I did not figure out until messing around with the map for a while, was that there is more information in pop-up boxes when clicking on the points that appear on the map. This was not mentioned in the **Using the Atlas** page, and being that all of the data is located within the points on the map, it should be included in the directions.

I also found that there was a very small "i" icon next to the timeline slider that could be hovered over for more information. The pop-up box reveals that the slider can be animated by dragging the points to a smaller selection and pressing the play button. It can also be panned manually using the left and right buttons on the right side of the page.

Lastly, they included a page full of embedded YouTube videos demonstrating how they made books during the "hand-press" era using 17th century tools. 

Overall, _The Atlas of Early Printing_ is very user-friendly and even fun to use. While I do not know much about 15th century printing, I learned a lot in the week that I was tinkering with the website. It is a great educational to that I would reccommend to anyone with an interest in history.
