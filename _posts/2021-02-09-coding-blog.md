# TEI Coding Review

I was tasked to code four pages of Charlotte Perkins Stetson's manuscript of _The Yellow Wall-Paper_. This short story is about a woman battling a mental illness, aided by her husband, who is also her physician. In order to transfer the manuscript into a digital medium, I used Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), or more specifically, Extensible Markup Language (XML). 

Before starting working on our code, we were assigned transcribed pages of text by Dr. Deanna Stover. I was given pages 55-58, the last 4 pages of the manuscript. We were directed to markup specific parts of the text, such as underlines, em dashes, spelling corrections, quotes, etc. We called this step of the process "TEI on paper" and we accomplished this in a Google Document. All our our annotated transcripts were available in a shared Google Drive, which made it easier to understand what each of us needed to do.

I used the highlight and comment functions to make my notations. I also designated where each paragraph started and ended using paragaph tags(`<p>` and `</p>`), as well as indicating where page breaks are.  This made it much easier and quicker to put text into the program we used to code, Oxygen. Most of my markups were comprised of quotes and em dashes.

When it came time to transfer my TEI to Oxygen, I felt very confident in my coding ability with three years of experience. I did not have any issues with my code, however, I was confused about whether or not to end a quote before or after a page break. I then learned that you could include a page break in the middle of a paragraph.

Overall, Oxygen was incredibly easy to use and was even easier after being given some of the code needed for the manuscript. While I was not worried about this project in particular due to my background with programming, I was surprised by how simple this project was to complete.
