# TEI Coding Review

I was tasked to code four pages of Charlotte Perkins Stetson's manuscript of _The Yellow Wall-Paper_. This short story is about a woman battling a mental illness, aided by her husband, who is also her physician. In order to transfer the manuscript into a digital medium, I used Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), or more specifically, Extensible Markup Language (XML). 

Before starting working on our code, we were assigned transcribed pages of text by Dr. Deanna Stover. We were directed to make notations on specific parts of the text, such as underlines, em dashes, spelling corrections, etc. We called this step of the process "TEI on paper" and we accomplished this in a Google Document. This made it much easier and quicker to put text into the program we used to code, Oxygen.
