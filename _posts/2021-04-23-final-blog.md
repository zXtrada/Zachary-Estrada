# Grant Process and Reflection

## Grant Process
I must admit that I was very intimidated by the Grant Project at first. However, I was relieved to learn that we were able to work in pairs. At first my partner and I had no idea where to start until we began to think of what fields of the humanities interested us. We both have a fascination with art and art history and I had recently developed an interest in Virtual Reality (VR) so we thought it would be perfect to combine the two. 

Our project is a 3-Dimensional recreation of Georges Seurat's _A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte_ to be viewed using a VR headset. The idea is that every aspect of the painting (the people, animals, trees, boats, etc), as well as the environment, is made into a 3D model so that the viewer can walk around and feel like they are living in the painting.  We thought it would be a great way to modernize art history and make it more accessible and enjoyable for younger audiences. While we only plan to recreate one painting into a virtual environment, we hope to inspire other people to do the same with their favorite works of art. 

The concept of the project has evolved significantly as we have worked with it more. We originally planned to just have the 3D models and the environment be painting with solid colors and be completely stationary. However, we decided that we wanted to paint a texture over the whole environment that would mimic the pointillistic style of Seurat to make it more authentic to the painting. We also wanted to give movement to the environment by having the water, the rowers in the boats, the animals, the leaves of the trees, and the people be animated without shifting from their places in the painting. Lastly, we wanted to add ambience to it with music, laughter, animal noises, leaves rustling, water flowing, etc. to give a full experience to the viewer.

While we did not find many similar projects that were explicitly DH, we found quite a few projects that combined classic art and virtual reality. Projects like SoulPancake’s “Explore a Painting in VR ‘A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte’: Art Attack Master Works” (above) and Exhibition Hub’s “Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience” (below) combine art and VR to make art accessible and more interactive for audiences.

While their projects and ours have similar goals in mind, ours intends to dive deeper into a more immersive experience for the viewer while also making it available for download to be explored at home.


## Class Reflection

The meaning of Digital Humanities has made much more sense to me as we have progressed through the class. I would not say that my definition changed over time, but rather, I have developed a further understanding of the field. After working on a DH project for myself and researching other DH projects and scholarship, I understand DH to be the combination of one or multiple field(s) of the Humanities and technology to present information in digital medium used to educate and further the field itself.

I really enjoyed coding the blogs using GitHub and also coding with TEI using Oxygen. It allowed me to use previous coding experience which is something I had not done since coming to college. However, I did struggle to keep up with Twitter posts. Although we were given things to tweet about weekly, I tend to procrastinate with assignments until the day they are due. So I became quickly discouraged when I found out that we would lose points for doing this.

I am very satisfied with taking this class and found that I am much more comfortable writing in this way than I am writing essays in other classes. If I had taken this class earlier in college, I might have considered a minor in Digital Humanities.
