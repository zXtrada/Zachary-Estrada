## My CNU Involvements
I am a Junior here at CNU. I am majoring in Theater with a concentration in Acting. I am the current Vice President of Recruitment for Delta Upsilon. I am also a brother of Alpha Psi Omega, the Theater Honor Society. I used to work as a Tour Guide for the University

## Why I took ENGL 350
I was interested in taking this course because I needed to fulfill my second Writing Intensive course. However, I was also very interested in the course after reading the description. I really enjoy working with computers and being able to write in the digital format and work with social media was quite intriguing.

## Career Aspirations
Once I graduate from CNU, I plan to work at my current job to save money and start to pay off student loans. I plan on living with my girlfriend while we support each other financially and work on our future. I eventually would like to move out of Virginia and pursue a career in voice acting while also making my own music. My big goals for my acting career are:
* Doing Voiceover for an animated Star Wars, Marvel, or DC show
* Play a role in a movie or TV show using motion capture
* *Have someone do a voice impression of one of my characters*
